### Recommendations


**Uri Sarid, CTO at MuleSoft Inc**: John is an incredible asset to any
software engineering team. First, he's technically brilliant, a rare
combination of a prototyper who can forge ahead into unknown
territories but also deliver high-quality product on tight
deadlines. He's also extremely versatile, not only possessing a broad
and deep skillset but able to pick up new ones quickly and
effectively. And he's now also proving to be a capable manager,
leading by example, taking tough decisions and following them through,
and earning the respect of his team. He has great gut instincts for
technology, for people, and for how software teams and companies
should function. I would genuinely look forward to the opportunity to
work together again in the future.

**Vince Gabrielsen, UI Engineer at eMeter Corporation**: John
possesses a rare combination of technical expertise and knowing how to
manage people; the years of engineering experience may be obvious, but
most with similar experience are not nearly as good at balancing the
needs of the company and employees. He is positive and always
encourages others to learn more and go beyond limited roles. It didn't
take long for me to realize that John was one of the best managers
I've worked for

**Martin Stein, Engineering Manager at Guidewire Software**: I worked
with John for 18 months at emeter, first he reported to me in the
backend group, and later he ran the UI team. We effectively managed
the product team together. John did a lot of hands-on work research
which direction to take. He contributed in many ways and was
incredibly productive. I enjoyed working with him immensely. He was
very respected by the team and still keeps in contact with many former
colleagues. My advice is if you can get him hire him.
