Inspired by Rands In Repose [Foamy Rules for
Rabid Tools](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2009/11/02/the_foamy_rules_for_rabid_tools.html);


Based on nothing more than the shear joy I feel when I use these
tools:

In no particular order, except for emacs which is seems to hold a
permanent spot at the top.



#### 1. emacs

#### 2. Opa

Opa is the future of web development. I 
[just wrote](https://blog.bcferrycoder.com/2012/11/17/i-have-seen-the-future/) about it in fact.

#### 3. Intellij Idea

I was staunchly opposed to using any sort of IDE given the first entry
in this list. Then a famous person convinced me to "just try NetBeans"
so i did, and I never turned back. Note this is for Java dev. It's
unfortunate that the language requires an ide. Ruby doesn't need an
IDE.
	     

#### 4. MTS Macros
