Inspired by Rands In Repose [Foamy Rules for
Rabid Tools](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2009/11/02/the_foamy_rules_for_rabid_tools.html).

Take a break, insert fresh sheet of creamy bond, and list the best
tools you've encountered since you started messing with
computers. By "best tools" I mean any "thing"
(language, IDE, library, framework, protocol analyzer, service, design pattern,
coding technique, test suite, methodology, the list goes on) that first,
**significantly improves life for you as a developer** and second, is a
**true pleasure to behold**.

Everyone's list is different. Mine is based on nothing more than the
shear joy I feel when I use these tools. These are listed in no
particular order, except that for some reason emacs always seems to
top the list.

## best tools EVER

I think Opa represents the future of web development. I [just wrote
about this
](http://blog.bcferrycoder.com/2012/11/17/i-have-seen-the-future/) in
fact.  http://blog.bcferrycoder.com/2012/11/17/i-have-seen-the-future/


#### Intellij Idea

I was staunchly opposed to using any sort of IDE given the first entry
in this list. Then a famous person convinced me to "just try NetBeans"
so i did, and I never turned back. Later I tried IDEA and THEN I never
turned back. IDEA makes Java fun again.

#### MTS Macros

#### Ruby on Rails

<img src="http://itekblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/railslogo.png">

In 2005 I built an internal Sun app based on Java Server Faces, then
shortly thereafter migrated the same app to Ruby on Rails. I kept
hearing "90% code reduction" blah blah, didn't believe it, just hype.

Then I measured the LoC before/after and... it achieved almost 90%. 

And Ruby alone seems to reduce annoying and unnecessary syntax by
about the same amount. I'm a fan.
